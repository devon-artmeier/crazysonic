# CrazySonic

This is the source code for CrazySonic, here for archival purposes. Feel free to take a look at the code, but beware, the code that I have written is from 2015 for that year's Sonic Hacking Contest, and is mostly spaghetti and not formatted consistently at all. I made this hack while I was still learning the ropes of programming for the Sega Genesis and working with 68000 assembly.

I did modify it a little. I slowed down the 420blazeit rainbow palette cycle and fixed a few bugs. However, the Desert Bus game mode is still unfinished and most likely will remain that way. I have absolutely no interest in finishing whatever I had planned back in 2015 that didn't make it in time for the contest.
