# CrazySonic

This is the source code for CrazySonic, here for archival purposes. Feel free to take a look at the code, but beware, the code that I have written is from 2015 for that year's Sonic Hacking Contest, and is mostly spaghetti and not formatted consistently at all. I made this hack while I was still learning the ropes of programming for the Sega Genesis and working with 68000 assembly. I did go out of my way to fix some bugs and make some minor improvements, though.
